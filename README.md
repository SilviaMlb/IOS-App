Certainly! I can help you get started with a basic iOS app using Swift. Here's a simple example of code for an iOS app with a single view controller: basic iOS app
This code sets up a basic iOS app with a single view controller (ViewController) containing a label and a button. When the button is clicked, it prints a message to the console.

To run this code, you'll need Xcode, Apple's integrated development environment for iOS app development. Create a new iOS project in Xcode, replace the content of the ViewController.swift file with the code above, and run the project on the iOS Simulator or a physical iOS device.

Please note that this is just a simple example to get you started. For more complex iOS apps, you'll need to learn about various iOS frameworks and concepts like navigation controllers, table views, and data models.
